# Loquela

Loquela is an implementation of the LDA topic modeling algorithm, paired with a visualization tool.

## Submodules

**LDA**: a directory containing LDA.py, some sample topic models, and other topic-modeling-related files.
**visulaization-tool**: a directory containing the Electron-packaged visualization tool for LDA outputs.

##Getting Started

**Running LDA**: LDA.py takes a configuration file as an argument and runs from the command line, outputting a JSON result upon completion. For more specific usage instructions, see the LDA README.
**Visualizing Output**: Loquela runs as a desktop app. Users can use Loquela to generate config files based on form entries, or upload an existing LDA output JSON.
