the,Abbot

of,Abbot
Egypt,Abbot
and,Abbot
Syria,Abbot
spread,Abbot
through,Abbot

and,Abbot
soon,Abbot
became,Abbot
accepted,Abbot
generally,Abbot
in,Abbot

as,Abbot
the,Abbot
designation,Abbot
of,Abbot
the,Abbot

The,Abbot

abba,Abbot
meaning,Abbot
my,Abbot

In,Abbot
the,Abbot
Septuagint,Abbot
it,Abbot
was,Abbot
written,Abbot
as,Abbot
abbas,Abbot
At,Abbot
first,Abbot
it,Abbot
was,Abbot
employed,Abbot
as,Abbot
a,Abbot
respectful,Abbot
title,Abbot
for,Abbot
any,Abbot
monk,Abbot
but,Abbot
it,Abbot
was,Abbot
soon,Abbot
restricted,Abbot
by,Abbot
canon,Abbot
law,Abbot
to,Abbot
certain,Abbot
priestly,Abbot
superiors,Abbot
At,Abbot
times,Abbot
it,Abbot
was,Abbot
applied,Abbot
to,Abbot
various,Abbot
priests,Abbot

at,Abbot

who,Abbot
had,Abbot
monks,Abbot
under,Abbot

By,Abbot
the,Abbot
Rule,Abbot
of,Abbot
St,Abbot

which,Abbot
until,Abbot
the,Abbot

was,Abbot

the,Abbot
West,Abbot
the,Abbot
abbot,Abbot
has,Abbot
jurisdiction,Abbot
over,Abbot
only,Abbot
one,Abbot
community,Abbot
The,Abbot
rule,Abbot
as,Abbot
was,Abbot
inevitable,Abbot
was,Abbot
subject,Abbot
to,Abbot
frequent,Abbot
violations,Abbot
but,Abbot
it,Abbot
was,Abbot
not,Abbot
until,Abbot
the,Abbot
foundation,Abbot
of,Abbot
the,Abbot
Cluniac,Abbot
Order,Abbot
that,Abbot
the,Abbot
idea,Abbot
of,Abbot
a,Abbot
supreme,Abbot
abbot,Abbot
exercising,Abbot
jurisdiction,Abbot
over,Abbot
all,Abbot
the,Abbot
houses,Abbot
of,Abbot
an,Abbot
order,Abbot
was,Abbot
definitely,Abbot
recognizedMonks,Abbot
as,Abbot
a,Abbot
rule,Abbot
were,Abbot
laymen,Abbot
nor,Abbot
at,Abbot
the,Abbot
outset,Abbot
was,Abbot
the,Abbot
abbot,Abbot
any,Abbot
exception,Abbot
For,Abbot
the,Abbot
reception,Abbot
of,Abbot
the,Abbot
sacraments,Abbot
and,Abbot
for,Abbot
other,Abbot
religious,Abbot
offices,Abbot
the,Abbot
abbot,Abbot
and,Abbot
his,Abbot
monks,Abbot
were,Abbot
commanded,Abbot
to,Abbot
attend,Abbot
the,Abbot
nearest,Abbot
church,Abbot
This,Abbot
rule,Abbot
proved,Abbot
inconvenient,Abbot
when,Abbot
a,Abbot
monastery,Abbot
was,Abbot
situated,Abbot
in,Abbot
a,Abbot
desert,Abbot
or,Abbot
at,Abbot
a,Abbot
distance,Abbot
from,Abbot
a,Abbot
city,Abbot
and,Abbot
necessity,Abbot
compelled,Abbot
the,Abbot
ordination,Abbot
of,Abbot
some,Abbot
monks,Abbot
This,Abbot
innovation,Abbot
was,Abbot
not,Abbot
introduced,Abbot
without,Abbot
a,Abbot
struggle,Abbot
ecclesiastical,Abbot
dignity,Abbot
being,Abbot
regarded,Abbot
as,Abbot
inconsistent,Abbot
with,Abbot
the,Abbot
higher,Abbot
spiritual,Abbot
life,Abbot
but,Abbot
before,Abbot
the,Abbot
close,Abbot
of,Abbot
the,Abbot
th,Abbot
century,Abbot
at,Abbot
least,Abbot
in,Abbot
the,Abbot
East,Abbot
abbots,Abbot
seem,Abbot
almost,Abbot
universally,Abbot
to,Abbot
have,Abbot
become,Abbot
deacons,Abbot
if,Abbot
not,Abbot
priests,Abbot
The,Abbot
change,Abbot
spread,Abbot
more,Abbot
slowly,Abbot
in,Abbot
the,Abbot
West,Abbot
where,Abbot
the,Abbot
office,Abbot
of,Abbot
abbot,Abbot
was,Abbot
commonly,Abbot
filled,Abbot
by,Abbot
laymen,Abbot
till,Abbot
the,Abbot
end,Abbot
of,Abbot
the,Abbot
th,Abbot
century,Abbot
The,Abbot
ecclesiastical,Abbot
leadership,Abbot
exercised,Abbot
by,Abbot
abbots,Abbot
despite,Abbot
their,Abbot
frequent,Abbot
lay,Abbot
status,Abbot
is,Abbot
proved,Abbot
by,Abbot
their,Abbot
attendance,Abbot
and,Abbot
votes,Abbot
at,Abbot
ecclesiastical,Abbot
councils,Abbot
Thus,Abbot

the,Abbot
right,Abbot
of,Abbot

to,Abbot
ordain,Abbot

to,Abbot
the,Abbot

used,Abbot
to,Abbot
be,Abbot

this,Abbot

To,Abbot
distinguish,Abbot
abbots,Abbot
from,Abbot

it,Abbot
was,Abbot
ordained,Abbot
that,Abbot
their,Abbot
mitre,Abbot
should,Abbot

made,Abbot
of,Abbot
less,Abbot
costly,Abbot
materials,Abbot
and,Abbot
should,Abbot
not,Abbot

with,Abbot

a,Abbot
rule,Abbot
which,Abbot
was,Abbot
soon,Abbot
entirely,Abbot
disregarded,Abbot
and,Abbot
that,Abbot
the,Abbot
crook,Abbot
of,Abbot

the,Abbot

should,Abbot
turn,Abbot

of,Abbot
outwards,Abbot
indicating,Abbot
that,Abbot
their,Abbot
jurisdiction,Abbot
was,Abbot
limited,Abbot
to,Abbot

houseThe,Abbot
adoption,Abbot
of,Abbot
certain,Abbot
episcopal,Abbot
insignia,Abbot

by,Abbot
abbots,Abbot
was,Abbot
followed,Abbot
by,Abbot
an,Abbot
encroachment,Abbot
on,Abbot
episcopal,Abbot
functions,Abbot
which,Abbot
had,Abbot
to,Abbot
be,Abbot
specially,Abbot
but,Abbot
ineffectually,Abbot
guarded,Abbot
against,Abbot
by,Abbot
the,Abbot
Lateran,Abbot
council,Abbot
AD,Abbot
In,Abbot

if,Abbot
in,Abbot
priests,Abbot
orders,Abbot
and,Abbot
with,Abbot
the,Abbot
consent,Abbot
of,Abbot
the,Abbot
bishop,Abbot
were,Abbot
as,Abbot
we,Abbot
have,Abbot
seen,Abbot
permitted,Abbot
by,Abbot
the,Abbot
second,Abbot
Nicene,Abbot
council,Abbot
AD,Abbot
to,Abbot
confer,Abbot
the,Abbot
tonsure,Abbot
and,Abbot
admit,Abbot
to,Abbot
the,Abbot
order,Abbot
of,Abbot
reader,Abbot
but,Abbot
gradually,Abbot
abbots,Abbot
in,Abbot
the,Abbot
West,Abbot
also,Abbot
advanced,Abbot
higher,Abbot
claims,Abbot
until,Abbot
we,Abbot
find,Abbot
them,Abbot
in,Abbot
AD,Abbot
permitted,Abbot
by,Abbot
Innocent,Abbot
IV,Abbot
to,Abbot
confer,Abbot
both,Abbot
the,Abbot
subdiaconate,Abbot
and,Abbot
diaconate,Abbot
Of,Abbot
course,Abbot
they,Abbot
always,Abbot
and,Abbot
everywhere,Abbot
had,Abbot
the,Abbot
power,Abbot
of,Abbot
admitting,Abbot
their,Abbot
own,Abbot
monks,Abbot
and,Abbot
vesting,Abbot
them,Abbot
with,Abbot
the,Abbot
religious,Abbot
habitThe,Abbot
power,Abbot
of,Abbot
the,Abbot
abbot,Abbot
was,Abbot
paternal,Abbot
but,Abbot
absolute,Abbot
limited,Abbot
however,Abbot
by,Abbot
the,Abbot
canon,Abbot
law,Abbot
One,Abbot
of,Abbot
the,Abbot
main,Abbot
goals,Abbot
of,Abbot
monasticism,Abbot
was,Abbot
the,Abbot
purgation,Abbot
of,Abbot
self,Abbot
and,Abbot
selfishness,Abbot
and,Abbot
obedience,Abbot
was,Abbot
seen,Abbot
as,Abbot
a,Abbot
path,Abbot
to,Abbot
that,Abbot
perfection,Abbot
It,Abbot
was,Abbot
sacred,Abbot
duty,Abbot
to,Abbot
execute,Abbot
the,Abbot
abbots,Abbot
orders,Abbot
and,Abbot
even,Abbot
to,Abbot
act,Abbot
without,Abbot
his,Abbot
orders,Abbot
was,Abbot
sometimes,Abbot
considered,Abbot
a,Abbot
transgression,Abbot

Egyptian,Abbot
monks,Abbot
of,Abbot
this,Abbot
submission,Abbot
to,Abbot
the,Abbot
commands,Abbot
of,Abbot
the,Abbot
superiors,Abbot
exalted,Abbot
into,Abbot

regarded,Abbot

of,Abbot
the,Abbot
new,Abbot
abbots,Abbot
journey,Abbot
to,Abbot
Rome,Abbot
It,Abbot
was,Abbot
necessary,Abbot
that,Abbot
an,Abbot

should,Abbot
be,Abbot
at,Abbot

In,Abbot

allowed,Abbot

of,Abbot
an,Abbot

in,Abbot

doing,Abbot
this,Abbot
and,Abbot
in,Abbot
later,Abbot

in,Abbot
the,Abbot
case,Abbot
of,Abbot
St,Abbot
Bruno,Abbot
Popes,Abbot
and,Abbot
sovereigns,Abbot
gradually,Abbot
encroached,Abbot
on,Abbot
the,Abbot
rights,Abbot
of,Abbot
the,Abbot
monks,Abbot
until,Abbot
in,Abbot
Italy,Abbot
the,Abbot

usurped,Abbot
the,Abbot

he,Abbot
might,Abbot
entertain,Abbot
guests,Abbot

opened,Abbot
the,Abbot

Synods,Abbot
of,Abbot

generally,Abbot
ineffectual,Abbot
to,Abbot
secure,Abbot
strictness,Abbot

But,Abbot
by,Abbot
the,Abbot
th,Abbot

the,Abbot

was,Abbot

the,Abbot

of,Abbot
an,Abbot

of,Abbot
Leicester,Abbot
c,Abbot
who,Abbot
was,Abbot
the,Abbot
most,Abbot

of,Abbot
all,Abbot
the,Abbot

In,Abbot

of,Abbot

and,Abbot

the,Abbot
abbots,Abbot
vied,Abbot
with,Abbot
the,Abbot
first,Abbot
nobles,Abbot
of,Abbot
the,Abbot
realm,Abbot
They,Abbot
rode,Abbot
on,Abbot

with,Abbot
gilded,Abbot

rich,Abbot
saddles,Abbot
and,Abbot
housings,Abbot
carrying,Abbot

on,Abbot
their,Abbot

followed,Abbot
by,Abbot
an,Abbot
immense,Abbot
train,Abbot

The,Abbot
bells,Abbot
of,Abbot
the,Abbot

were,Abbot
rung,Abbot
as,Abbot
they,Abbot

They,Abbot
associated,Abbot
on,Abbot
equal,Abbot

with,Abbot

of,Abbot
the,Abbot
highest,Abbot

and,Abbot
shared,Abbot
all,Abbot
their,Abbot

This,Abbot
rank,Abbot
and,Abbot

was,Abbot
however,Abbot
often,Abbot
used,Abbot
most,Abbot
beneficially,Abbot
For,Abbot

of,Abbot

of,Abbot

murdered,Abbot
by,Abbot

he,Abbot
fitted,Abbot
for,Abbot
the,Abbot

His,Abbot
table,Abbot
attendance,Abbot
and,Abbot
officers,Abbot
were,Abbot
an,Abbot
honour,Abbot
to,Abbot
the,Abbot

He,Abbot
would,Abbot
entertain,Abbot
as,Abbot
many,Abbot
as,Abbot
persons,Abbot
of,Abbot

at,Abbot
one,Abbot

besides,Abbot
relieving,Abbot
the,Abbot

of,Abbot
the,Abbot

twice,Abbot
a,Abbot

He,Abbot
had,Abbot
his,Abbot

and,Abbot
when,Abbot
he,Abbot
travelled,Abbot
to,Abbot
attend,Abbot

his,Abbot
retinue,Abbot
amounted,Abbot
to,Abbot
upwards,Abbot
of,Abbot

The,Abbot
